Wow. Okay. So, I'm just out of the theater, hunched awkwardly on this splintery bench, still trying to process what just happened in Rosario. My back is killing me, like I’ve been wrestling with an alligator, the theater's sticky floors echoing every shuffle around me. It’s like the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 clung to me, just like these stray popcorn crumbs caught in my sweater creases.

So, Rosario—god, where to start? Total chaos and brilliance. Like a kaleidoscope had a nap and then exploded. Scenes fluttered around my brain, like frenzied butterflies caught in a wind tunnel—one second you're deep in this tranquil forest, the next second everything's on fire, forests shrinking like cotton candy in water, and you just sit there, wide-eyed and wondering if this is an ecological disaster or just a Tuesday for Rosario.

> Anyway, the protagonist—she was like this ferocious ecosystem, right? Teetering between life and decay, reminded me somehow of this old oak in my yard balancing a bird's nest and a hornet's hive. Her journey felt like walking a tightrope in high heels, through a thunderstorm, while carrying a massive stack of over-studied ecology textbooks. Things kept shifting around her but she just found a way, like roots curling over stones.

Did I mention the sound? More chaotic than a raccoon family in a trash bin, echoing through my skull, overlapping with the annoyingly jarring squeak of theater seats. And the visuals? Like trying to untangle a mess of Christmas lights under a disco ball—unexpectedly hypnotic, and yet endlessly frustrating.

Oh, someone had asked if you could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  —hmmm, maybe, but it feels like it should just be experienced, in its cinema cocoon, with the chaos embracing you like an unhinged storm. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , yes, preferably before your head's completely consumed by daily entropy.

It’s all so—ah, losing my train of thought. It was messy! Like that time I tried mapping plant growth with crayon on a slippery fridge door kind of messy. Barely graspable but kind of stunning. I’m not even sure half the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 made sense, like listening to a beetle recital where they all speak different bug languages—loud and nerve-tingling in a good, bizarre way.
